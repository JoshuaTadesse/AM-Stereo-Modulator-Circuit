# FM-Stereo-Modulator-Circuit
This circuit modulates messages based on a stereo based, dual channel frequency modulation technique
The first section divides the message into two parts, stereo. Then it is modulated on a band pass signal of high frequency to be sent 
to the channel. The amplitude is modulated according to the message, and is sent to the channel. The channel is then multiplexed to select
the appropriate sections. Finally, on the receiver side, the receiver receives the message and uses selector circuit to select the 
correct channel. this is then sent to a speaker to be heard.
